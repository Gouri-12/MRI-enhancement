##  Project Overview
This project focuses on developing methods to enhance the quality and visibility of **MRI scans**, making them more suitable for medical diagnosis and research. The enhancement techniques include **histogram equalization**, various filtering methods (e.g., **Gaussian**, **median**, and **Wiener**), and contrast enhancement approaches such as **adaptive histogram equalization**. These methods aim to reduce noise, highlight key features, and improve the overall clarity of MRI images.
